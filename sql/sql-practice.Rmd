# PART 2: INTERPRETING THE SQL QUERIES



There are a total of five queries. Each group has to try to interpret them. The fastest group with the correct answer will get a point. Do not read out the query directly for the interpretation. Tell exactly what information will be shown from the query.


print(dbGetQuery(con, "select max(Milliseconds), avg(Milliseconds)  from Track;"))

print(dbGetQuery(con, "select distinct AlbumID from Track"))

print(dbGetQuery(con, "select trackid ,name from Track where Bytes < 1000000"))

print(dbGetQuery(con, "select name, title from Album join Artist using(ArtistId)"))

print(dbGetQuery(con, "select track.name,album.title from track join album using(albumid) where title = 'Supernatural'"))
